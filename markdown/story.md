## October 10, 1975

<!-- Note -->
The day is October 10, 1975.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/doctor.png" data-background-size="contain" -->
## Young doc on shift <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
And on this autumn Friday, a young doctor, fresh out of medical
school, is on shift in the emergencies and accidents ward in the
hospital of a Swedish coastal town of about 35,000 people.

It’s been a very calm morning, and it’s now lunchtime and most of the
senior personnel – doctors and nurses — are down in the hospital
cafeteria for lunch. Everything looks and feels very routine.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/phone.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->
## Phone call <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
And then suddenly, the phone rings. The hospital is being advised by
emergency responders that a plane crash has occurred in the vicinity,
and that the hospital will imminently receive the first casualties,
by helicopter.

As soon as the young doctor hangs up, he grabs a nurse and they race
over to the shelf with the binders containing the emergency
procedures, because they now have to immediately prepare the ER for a
mass-casualty contingency, so: set up triage procedures, remove
all non-essential vehicles from the parking lot, activate personnel
that’s on call, etc, etc. 

But their frantic preparation is cut short when they hear the chopper
land on the hospital’s pad, and seconds later the first patient is
wheeled through the ER doors on a stretcher.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/emergency-room.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->
## First patient in <!-- .element: class="hidden" --> 

<!-- Note -->
And the doctor immediately starts evaluating the patient. He is
conscious and breathing, but he’s not in great shape: he is shaking
violently, he is incoherent, and when the doctor addresses him he
can’t verbally respond — all he utters is a sound like /ʒʒʒʒʒʒʒ/. The
doctor immediately recognizes this as symptoms consistent with
cerebral trauma; the patient evidently has a head injury and could
lose consciousness any moment.

As he’s examined the patient, the doctor has removed the patient’s
life jacket (it was a plane crash into water), dropping it on the
floor. And what he sees now is a military flight suit that the patient
is wearing: he is evidently dealing with an fighter or bomber
pilot. 

And suddenly the penny drops for the doctor that the /ʒʒʒ/ sound that
the pilot was making could have been an attempt to speak Russian. The
doctor speaks a little Russian from classes he took at university, so
to reassure the patient that he’ll be all right he says: “Я врач. Вы в
шведской больнице.” (Ya vrach, vy v shvedskoy bolnitse) — “I am a
doctor, you are in a Swedish hospital.”


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/roundel.svg" data-background-size="contain" -->
## A Soviet pilot <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
And at this, the pilot’s eyes widen in horror. He’s still not
responding, but to the doctor the picture is clear: this is a Soviet
pilot who is understandably terrified that he’s been shot down over
hostile territory. 

And the comes to a dismal conclusion: if we’re shooting down Soviet
jets, then we’re probably at war with the Soviet Union. And *that,* in
turn, means that we’re probably in the opening minutes of World War
III (remember, this is 1975).


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/blood.jpg" data-background-size="cover" -->
## Blood loss <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
But as he momentarily looks down, he realizes that he has an urgent
problem on his hands with this patient: he is standing in a red puddle
that has formed on the floor. So this patient evidently doesn’t just
suffer from cerebral trauma, but he also has an open wound, possibly
an arterial bleeding _that they haven’t found yet._ So they need to
get his flight suit off of him as soon as possible.


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="images/g-suit.jpg" data-background-color="black" data-background-size="contain" -->
## A problem with the flight suit <!-- .element: class="hidden" --> 

<!-- Note -->
Unfortunately, the doctor isn’t very accustomed to patients wearing
military flight suits, so he’s running into a snag: he simply can’t
find the right zippers or buckles to get the suit off of the
pilot. Whatever he tries, all he manages to open is one of the many
pockets the suit has. So, he grabs a pair of scissors to cut the suit
open.

Now it’s something like 90 seconds after the call, and the senior
doctors and nurses finally pour in from where they had spent their
lunch break. And just as he’s about to cut into the flight suit, a
nurse stops him and says “don’t do that, that’s a G-suit, those are
thousands of kronor apiece” (in 1975 kronor — multiply by about 5.7 to
account for inflation).

And the doctor looks at her, momentarily befuddled. She adds: 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="https://airandspace.si.edu/webimages/collections/full/A19790681000d3.JPG" data-background-size="cover" -->
## Paint, not blood <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
“.... and you may want to step off his rescue jacket; looks like you
popped the sea-dye marker cartridge and you’re making a mess all over
the floor.”

After which she expertly strips the patient of his flight suit, and
the evaluation of the patient continues.

## Accident record <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
The patient who, it turns out, is a Swedish air force pilot who was
forced to eject from his Saab AJ 37 Viggen strike fighter, tail
number 37005. 

He had been on a routine training flight over the Baltic sea, when
lost control of his plane to a structural failure — a _wing fracture,_
a problem which plagued the airframe in the mid-70s — and who was
pulled out of the 8°C water by a search-and-rescue team. 

Which flew him promptly to the nearest hospital because he was
suffering from a rather bad case of hypothermia, the symptoms of which
include incoherence, slurred speech, and violent shivers.


<!-- .slide: data-background-color="black" data-background-size="contain" -->
## Nothing but wrong assumptions <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
And the reason I’m telling you this is that absolutely every single
assumption the doctor had made was wrong, with one exception: there
was, actually, a plane crash. But:

* It involved a single-seat military aircraft, rather than a
  commercial airliner.
* Thus, mass casualty treatment was never required — they were all
  dealing with a single accident survivor all along.
* The patient wasn’t suffering from cerebral trauma, but hypothermia.
* The patient wasn’t trying to speak Russian; he simply couldn’t get
  any words out — again, due to his hypothermia.
* The patient wasn’t suffering from sudden catastrophic bleeding,
  instead the red puddle came from a fluorescent sea-dye marker
  cartridge (those look green when dissolved, but bright red when
  concentrated — see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFlh61jRnf0
  for a demonstration).

And of course, Sweden was not at war with the Soviet Union, and
nuclear armageddon wasn’t imminent.


<!-- .slide: data-background-color="black" data-background-size="contain" -->
## Lessons learned <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
Thankfully for the doctor, none of the decisions he made based on his
wildly inaccurate assumptions actually harmed anyone — other than, of
course, scaring the living daylights out of Swedish Air Force Reserve
Lt Harald Gatel, who after what must have already been the worst day
of his flying career, came to to find out that rather than being pulled
from the Baltic Sea by his collegues, he’d been presumably abducted by
a team of Spetsnaz and spirited away to somewhere where the doctors
only spoke Russian.

And he reflected later in life that he was actually quite thankful for
this inconsequential mishap early in his career, as it profoundly and
permanently influenced his later thinking: always challenge your own
assumptions.

## What became of the doctor <!-- .element: class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
The young doctor incidentally became a very famous man with this
approach: 

* in the early 1980s, he discovered a working prevention mechanism for
  konzo (bound legs disease),

* he became professor of International Health at Karolinska Institute
  in 1995,

* and in the early 2000s rose to internet fame with his data
  visualizations and riveting commentary about public health issues.

So! Let’s take Hans’ advice and apply it to operating and running
OpenStack: let’s always challenge our own assumptions.
